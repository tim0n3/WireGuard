## WireGuard
Road Warrior Installation
**Previous: [OpenVPN](https://github.com/tim0n3/OpenVPN) is also available.**

WireGuard [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Fedora.

This script will let you set up your own wireguard VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used WireGuard before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tim0n3/OpenVPN/main/quickVPN.sh -O wgVPN.sh && bash wgVPN.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall WireGuard.
